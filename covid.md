# Changes for ECE 590 assessment
Summary:

1. The final project and the homework are probably the most important aspect at this time (more about this below).
1. The midterm will now be a takehome that will be due two week after distribution. It's goal and function is for you to review the material in the first part of the class.
1. There will be one more journal club exercise on methods related to Q-learning.

## Final project
We will focus our energies on final projects. To facilitate this and be flexible, I will allow you to work in groups or individually. We will start with the following list
to get this started.

1. Fill out a summary of what you will do: *todo: link to google sheet or office365*
1. Complete a template for yourself or your group and share it with me *todo: link template*


## Midterm
The following midterm reflects the review I gave before springbreak part I. My intention is that all of these answer are readily obtainable from either the resources I have used
or note of their presentation. The learning goal here is review and solidify your knowledge. As described in the directions, you may work together, but do not present the work of
others as your own---that is, write your answers in your own words.

## Homework
Homework 3 will be our final homework for the semester. It was techinically challenging because of resources and time. I'd like to revisit this homework using collab and other cloud
resources.
